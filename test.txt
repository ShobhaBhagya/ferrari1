Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, tracking changes to files and managing different versions of the codebase.

Repositories
A Git repository is a directory or folder that contains your project's files, as well as the entire history of changes made to those files. It acts as a central hub for collaboration.

Commits
In Git, a commit represents a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Each commit is associated with a unique identifier (a hash) and contains information such as the author, timestamp, and a message describing the changes made in that commit.

Branches
Git allows you to create branches, which are independent lines of development. Each branch can have its own commits, allowing multiple developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously. Branches make it easy to experiment, collaborate, and merge changes back into the main codebase.

Working Directory, Staging Area, and Repository
Git has three main areas:

Working Directory: This is the directory on your local machine where you modify and create files.

Staging Area (Index): The staging area is an intermediate area where you select and stage the changes you want to include in the next commit. You can think of it as a holding area for changes you want to commit.

Repository: The repository is where Git stores the complete history of your project, including all the committed changes. It is usually located in the hidden .git folder within your project directory.
